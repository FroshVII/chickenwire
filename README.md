Everything in Chickenwire owes a huge thanks to **Red Blob Games**, for making

excellent article on the development of hexagonal grids.

Chickenwire would not be possible without
[bluss' petgraph](https://github.com/bluss/petgraph). A huge thanks to
**bluss**, **mitchmindtree**, and everyone else who contributed to the
project.
