# Contribution Guide

First of all, thank you so much for your interest in the Chickenwire project!

I'm fairly new to both Rust and GitHub, not to mention still an undergrad, so
if you have any experienced advice, I'm really eager to learn and improve.

Now, on to brass tacks:

## Background Reading
If you haven't already, please read up on the
[GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) before
continuing with this guide or making contributions.

You might also find it helpful to refer to Red Blob Games' guide on hexagonal
grids (a.k.a. [The Guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons)), which
Chickenwire is heavily based upon.

## Code Contributions
If you're an expert on Rust, then welcome. Go ham.

If you're a web developer interested in the project, Chickenwire has a demo
site in the works which could really use some help.

## Non-Code Contributions
Documentation, issue filing, suggestions, and feedback are all super helpful.

I'm also looking for someone to design a page image, just to give Chickenwire
a brand identity.

The contribution and style guides might get a little outdated or in need of
improvement. Feel free to post an issue if you think that's the case.

## Versioning
Like all Rust projects, Chickenwire uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Management
If you have experience running a GitHub project, I'm always on the lookout for
people to deputize. Please contact me if you're interested and qualified.
